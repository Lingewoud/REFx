REFx
=====

REFx is a webservice manager running on Mac OS X. Services are implemented as plugable bundles. REFx is facilitates the communication with the website and has a smart queque manager. A request does not have to return instantly but the results can be retrieved later when the job has finished. Web applications can communicate using XMLRPC to inject jobs. A JSON API will soon be added. 

REFx is developed as a server component for the PAS3 Front End. Currently REFx works perfectly with the PAS3 extensions available for TYPO3, but it could work with any web application.

* XMLRPC interface
* Job scheduler with priorities
* Extendable with plugins
* Open plugin architecture using Ruby/AppScript/Mac Bundles
* Native Cocoa Interface
