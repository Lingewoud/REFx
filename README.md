REFx4 is developed as a server component for the PAS3 Front End. Currently REFx4 works perfectly with the PAS3 extensions available for TYPO3, but it could work with any web application.

* XMLRPC interface
* Job scheduler with priorities
* Extendable with plugins
* Open plugin architecture using RAILS/Ruby/AppScript
