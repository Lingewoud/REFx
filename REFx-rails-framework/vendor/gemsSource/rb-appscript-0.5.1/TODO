TO DO

- Add a libxml2-based sdef parser for use by OSAX::ScriptingAddition in 64-bit Leopard as OSAGetAppTerminology is not available there. (note: OSAGetAppTerminology, OSACopyScriptingDefinition should be weakly bound in rbae.c)

- can numbers in range (2**63)..(2**64 - 1) safely be packed as typeUInt64 on 10.5+? Or stick with packing those as lossy 64-bit floating point for compatibility?

- unpack support for typeISO8601DateTime (10.1+), typeCFAbsoluteTime (10.5+)?

- _aem/connect.rb module refers directly to Send::Event instead of going via the AEM::Application::Event hook, which might cause problems when used in an OSA component or other situation where client needs to customise all event creation and/or dispatch.

- #== and #hash methods in MacTypes::Alias, MacTypes::FileURL lack robustness; see notes in mactypes manual for details. Could these be improved? (Note: some mactypes unit tests may fail in some situations due to 'dumb' nature of these methods.)

- support string encodings in Ruby 1.9
