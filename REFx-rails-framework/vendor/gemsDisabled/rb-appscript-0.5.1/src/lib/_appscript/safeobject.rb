# safeobject -- ensure Appscript::Reference#method_missing works reliably

#

# Notes:

# A modified, updated version of basicobject (http://facets.rubyforge.org/), used to provide
# Appscript::Reference and Appscript#GenericReference with stable superclasses.

# Unfortunately, Ruby makes it ludicrously easy for users to accidentally add new methods
# to the Object class. And if these methods' names are the same as application keywords, 
# Ruby will invoke them instead of Reference#method_missing, resulting in incorrect behaviour.
#
# e.g. The following code demonstrates the problem in an unpatched copy of appscript 0.2.1.
# Including modules in the main script for convenience is a not-uncommon practice; unfortunately,
# because main's class is Object, this causes the additional methods to appear on every other
# object in the system as well (very bad).
#
#######
# require 'appscript'
#
# module X
#	def name
#		puts 'X.name was called'
#		return 999
#	end
# end
# include X
#
# Appscript.app('textedit').name.get
########
#
# Result:
#
# # X.name was called
# # /tmp/tmpscript:13: undefined method `get' for 999:Fixnum (NoMethodError)

# The AS_SafeObject class undefines any methods not on the EXCLUDE safe list; traps are
# then applied to Module#method_added and Module#included to detect any subsequent
# method additions and immediately remove those from AS_SafeObject as well.

# Having to insert traps into other users' runtimes isn't exactly an ideal solution, but 
# unless/until Ruby comes up with a safe, sane system for including modules in main that
# doesn't pollute every other namespace as well, it may be the only practical solution. The
# only other alternative would be a major redesign+rewrite of the appscript module to use 
# metaclasses (c.f. js-appscript) instead of method_missing, but this is not really desireable
# as it'd be much more complicated to implement, slower to initialise, and less elegant to
# use (since GenericReferences would have to be dropped).
