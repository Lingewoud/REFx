Appscript Read Me

======================================================================
ABOUT

Ruby appscript (rb-appscript) is a high-level Apple event bridge for the Ruby scripting language. rb-appscript is closely based on the Python appscript (py-appscript) bridge.

See the doc folder for more information.

======================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

- Mac OS X 10.3+
- Ruby 1.8+

======================================================================
INSTALLATION

$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
$ sudo make install

-------

Please note that the version of Ruby included with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is missing the header files needed to build appscript on PPC-based Macs. Tiger users can avoid this issue by installing the latest version of Ruby from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/> and updating their shell login profiles to suit.
