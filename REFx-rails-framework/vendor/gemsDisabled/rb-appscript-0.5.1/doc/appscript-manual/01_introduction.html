<h2>What is appscript?</h2>

<p>Ruby appscript (rb-appscript) is a high-level, user-friendly Apple event bridge that allows you to control scriptable Mac OS X applications using ordinary Ruby scripts. Appscript makes Ruby a serious alternative to Apple's own AppleScript language for automating your Mac.</p>

<p>For example, to get the value of the first paragraph of the topmost document in TextEdit:</p>

<pre><code>app('TextEdit').documents[1].paragraphs[1].get</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the AppleScript statement:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "TextEdit"
    get paragraph 1 of document 1
end tell</code></pre>

<p>Appscript builds upon lower-level Ruby modules (ae, aem) to provide:</p>

<ol>
<li>a high-level <em>RPC mechanism</em> for sending commands to applications via Apple events</li>
<li>a mechanism for converting data between common Ruby and Apple event types</li>
<li>a simple <em>embedded query language</em> for identifying one or more objects in an application's object model</li>
<li>a mechanism for representing these object model "references" in human-readable form based on application-defined terminology</li>
<li>a clean, <em>object oriented-like </em> syntax for ease of use.</li>
</ol>



<h2>"Hello World!"</h2>

<p>The following script uses appscript to create a new "Hello World!" document in TextEdit:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "appscript"
include Appscript

app('TextEdit').documents.end.make(
    :new => :document,
    :with_properties => {:text => "Hello World!\n"}
    )</code></pre>



<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Ruby appscript (rb-appscript) is a port of the robust, mature Python appscript (py-appscript) bridge. There are a few minor syntax and API changes to accomodate the differences between the two languages, and rb-appscript lacks the built-in help system provided by py-appscript (external help tools will be provided at a later date), but apart from that they are very similar.</p>

<p>Please note that rb-appscript, like py-appscript, takes a few liberties with traditional Ruby syntax and semantics in order to support the behaviours and features provided by the Apple Event Manager API. These differences are noted in later chapters.</p>
